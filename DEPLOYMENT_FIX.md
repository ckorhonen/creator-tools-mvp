# Deployment Fix Documentation

## Issues Fixed

This PR addresses the deployment failures in the "Deploy to Cloudflare" workflow:

### 1. **npm cache issue**
- **Problem**: The workflow used `cache: 'npm'` and `cache-dependency-path` which require `package-lock.json` files to exist in the repository.
- **Solution**: Removed npm caching from the workflow. The files will be generated during `npm ci`.

### 2. **Workers D1 Database Configuration**
- **Problem**: The `wrangler.toml` had an empty `database_id` field which causes deployment to fail.
- **Solution**: Commented out the `database_id` line and added clear instructions for setting it up.

### 3. **Route Configuration**
- **Problem**: The route pattern required a zone that likely isn't configured yet.
- **Solution**: Commented out the route configuration until the custom domain is set up.

## Next Steps Required

### Before Merging This PR:

1. **Generate package-lock.json files**:
   ```bash
   # In the root directory
   npm install
   
   # In the workers/api directory
   cd workers/api
   npm install
   ```
   Commit both `package-lock.json` files to the repository.

2. **Create the D1 Database**:
   ```bash
   wrangler d1 create creator_tools_db
   ```
   This will output a database ID. Update `workers/api/wrangler.toml` with the ID:
   ```toml
   database_id = "your-database-id-here"
   ```

3. **Initialize the Database Schema**:
   ```bash
   cd workers/api
   wrangler d1 execute creator_tools_db --file=./schema.sql
   ```

4. **Set GitHub Secrets**:
   Make sure the following secrets are configured in your repository:
   - `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` - Your Cloudflare API token with Pages and Workers permissions
   - `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` - Your Cloudflare account ID
   - `VITE_API_URL` - The URL where your Workers API will be deployed
   - `VITE_TWITTER_CLIENT_ID` (optional)
   - `VITE_LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID` (optional)
   - `VITE_INSTAGRAM_APP_ID` (optional)

5. **Set Cloudflare Workers Secrets** (after first deployment):
   ```bash
   wrangler secret put TWITTER_API_KEY
   wrangler secret put TWITTER_API_SECRET
   wrangler secret put LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID
   wrangler secret put LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET
   wrangler secret put INSTAGRAM_APP_ID
   wrangler secret put INSTAGRAM_APP_SECRET
   ```

### After Initial Deployment:

6. **Configure Custom Domain** (optional):
   Once you have a custom domain configured in Cloudflare, uncomment the route section in `wrangler.toml`:
   ```toml
   [route]
   pattern = "api.creator-tools.com/*"
   zone_name = "creator-tools.com"
   ```

## Testing the Fix

After making the changes above and merging this PR, push to main to trigger the workflow. It should:

1. ✅ Install dependencies successfully
2. ✅ Build the frontend
3. ✅ Deploy to Cloudflare Pages
4. ✅ Deploy the Workers API

## Additional Notes

- The Workers deployment will work without a D1 database configured, but database operations will fail at runtime
- Consider creating separate environments (dev/staging/production) for better deployment practices
- The cron trigger is set to run every 5 minutes - adjust as needed for your publishing schedule
