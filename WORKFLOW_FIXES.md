# GitHub Actions Workflow Fixes

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### Issue 1: Missing package-lock.json Files
**Problem**: The workflow was using `npm ci` which requires `package-lock.json` files to be present. Both the root project and `workers/api` directories were missing these files.

**Symptoms**:
- Frontend deployment failing with "npm ci requires package-lock.json"
- Workers deployment failing with same error

**Fix Applied** (Commit: 2a1dcc6):
Updated `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to check for package-lock.json existence:
```yaml
- name: Install dependencies
  run: |
    if [ -f package-lock.json ]; then
      npm ci
    else
      npm install
    fi
```

**Status**: ✅ Fixed

### Issue 2: Invalid wrangler.toml Configuration
**Problem**: The `wrangler.toml` file had several blocking issues:
1. Empty `database_id` field causing deployment to fail
2. Custom route configuration requiring manual domain setup
3. Cron triggers that would fail without database

**Symptoms**:
- Workers deployment failing with "database_id is required"
- Deployment trying to use custom domains not yet configured

**Fix Applied** (Commit: 41c9ce2):
Updated `workers/api/wrangler.toml`:
- Commented out D1 database configuration (to be set up manually after first deployment)
- Removed custom route configuration
- Commented out cron triggers (to be enabled after database setup)

**Status**: ✅ Fixed

---

### Issue 3: Worker Code Requires Database
**Problem**: The worker code (`workers/api/src/index.ts`) expected the database binding to always be present, causing runtime errors when DB was not configured.

**Symptoms**:
- Worker deployment succeeding but runtime failures
- API endpoints returning 500 errors
- Health check failing

**Fix Applied** (Commit: 5a81b72):
Updated `workers/api/src/index.ts`:
- Made DB binding optional in Env interface: `DB?: D1Database`
- Added database existence checks before operations
- Enhanced health check to show database status
- Return 503 with helpful message when DB not configured
- Gracefully handle missing database in cron jobs

**Status**: ✅ Fixed

## Deployment Now Works in Stages

### Stage 1: Initial Deployment (Now Working)
The workflow can now deploy successfully without any pre-configuration:
1. ✅ Frontend builds and deploys to Cloudflare Pages
2. ✅ Workers API deploys to Cloudflare Workers
3. ✅ Health check endpoint works: `/health`

### Stage 2: Database Setup (Manual - After Initial Deployment)
To enable full functionality:
```bash
cd workers/api

# Create D1 database
wrangler d1 create creator_tools_db

# Copy database_id from output and update wrangler.toml
# Uncomment the [[d1_databases]] section and add your database_id

# Initialize database with schema
wrangler d1 execute creator_tools_db --file=./schema.sql

# Deploy with database
wrangler deploy
```

### Stage 3: Secrets Configuration (Manual)
Set up API secrets for platform integrations:
```bash
cd workers/api
wrangler secret put TWITTER_API_KEY
wrangler secret put TWITTER_API_SECRET
wrangler secret put LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID
wrangler secret put LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET
wrangler secret put INSTAGRAM_APP_ID
wrangler secret put INSTAGRAM_APP_SECRET
```

### Stage 4: Enable Cron Jobs (Manual)
Uncomment cron configuration in `wrangler.toml` and redeploy:
```toml
[triggers]
crons = ["*/5 * * * *"]
```

## Required GitHub Secrets

For the workflow to deploy successfully, these secrets must be set in the repository:

### Required for Deployment
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` - Cloudflare API token with Workers and Pages permissions
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` - Your Cloudflare account ID

### Optional (For Frontend Environment)
- `VITE_API_URL` - URL of deployed Workers API
- `VITE_TWITTER_CLIENT_ID` - Twitter OAuth client ID
- `VITE_LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID` - LinkedIn OAuth client ID
- `VITE_INSTAGRAM_APP_ID` - Instagram app ID

---

## Testing the Deployment

### 1. Check Workflow Status
Go to: https://github.com/ckorhonen/creator-tools-mvp/actions

### 2. Test Frontend
Visit your Cloudflare Pages URL (shown in deployment logs)

### 3. Test Workers API
```bash
# Health check (should work immediately)
curl https://your-worker-url.workers.dev/health

# Should return:
# {"status":"ok","timestamp":"...","database":"not configured"}

# After database setup:
curl https://your-worker-url.workers.dev/health
# Should return:
# {"status":"ok","timestamp":"...","database":"configured"}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Frontend Build Fails
**Check**: 
- Are all dependencies valid in `package.json`?
- Is TypeScript compilation succeeding?

**Solution**: Run locally first:
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

### Workers Deployment Fails
**Check**:
- Is `wrangler.toml` valid TOML syntax?
- Are there TypeScript compilation errors?

**Solution**: Test locally:
```bash
cd workers/api
npm install
npx wrangler dev
```

### Workers Deploy Succeeds but Runtime Errors
**Check**:
- Are you trying to use database endpoints before configuring DB?
- Check worker logs: `npx wrangler tail`

**Solution**: Follow Stage 2 setup instructions above
